/**
 * An Elastic Pool is an object pool that can dynamically shrink and grow.
 * Normally, an element is obtained by a client and then returned to the pool
 * after use. However, if the element gets into a bad state, the client can
 * also discard the element. This will cause the element to be removed from
 * the pool, and for a subsequent request, a new element can be created
 * on the fly to replace the discarded one.
 *
 * The pool starts with zero (active) elements. Every time a client attempts
 * to obtain an element, an element from the pool is returned if available.
 * Otherwise, if the number of active elements is less than the pool's limit,
 * a new element is created (using abstract method create(), this must be
 * overridden by all implementations), and the number of active elements is
 * increased by one. If the limit is reached, then obtain() blocks until
 * either an element is returned to the pool, or an element is discarded,
 * allowing for the creation of a new element.
 *
 * Every time an element is discarded, it is "destroyed" in order to properly
 * release all it resources before discarding. Every time an element is
 * returned to the pool, it is "recycled" to restore its fresh state for the
 * next use.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the elements
 * @param <E> the type of exception thrown by create()
